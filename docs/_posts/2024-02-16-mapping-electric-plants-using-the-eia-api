# Mapping Electicity Plants

I have been trying to gain a better understanding of where the electricity that enters my home originates. As part of that, I began exploring the U.S. Energy Administration's API which provides a wide variety of US energy data. In a [post from earlier this month](https://biketobass.github.io/computer/python/eia/api/software/data/datascience/2024/02/01/using-the-eia-api.html), I describe the [Python code available on GitHub](https://github.com/biketobass/eia-api) that I wrote to access that API. In this post, I describe an addition to that code that maps all of the electric plants within a region and visually shows both the type of fuel used at each plant and its nameplate capacity (intended full-load output).

The code addition is a method in the `Eia` class called `map_electric_plants`. It takes a region specified by a list of facets (see [my earlier post](https://biketobass.github.io/computer/python/eia/api/software/data/datascience/2024/02/01/using-the-eia-api.html) for a dicussion of facets) and outputs both static (PNG) and dynamic (HTML) [Plotly Express scatter_mapbox](https://plotly.com/python/scattermapbox/) images. Below is an example of a static map of the electric plants in Massachusetts.

And here is a [dynamic version of the same map](/assets/open_street_map.html).

# OpenStreetMap vs Mapbox

The maps above use [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/) map data as the base map. This is the default and convenient since OpenStreetMap does not require an API token.

It is also possible to use [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/) map data by setting the `mapbox` flag to `True`. To use Mapbox, however, you first need to register with Mapbox for an API token and add it to the `api_json` file as described in the README of my [repository](https://github.com/biketobass/eia-api).

Here is what the same static map looks like using Mapbox.

# Keyword Args

`EIA.map_electric_plants` takes several key word arguments. I describe each below:

- `facets`: This is a dictionary of facets used to define the region of interest. In the examples above `facets={'stateid':['MA']}`. You could produce a map of all New England States with `facets={'stateid':['MA', "NH", "CT", "ME", "VT", "RI"]}`
- `start`: You can pretty much ignore this. The call to the EIA API needs a start date for the data it retrieves. Since the method uses only the latest reporting period, you should not need to change the default.
- `open_street`: If True (the default), it uses OpenStreetMap underlying map data.
- `mapbox`: If True (not the default), it uses Mapbox data and requires a Mapbox API token (see the README).
- `dynamic_fig_title`: The title to appear on the dynamic, interactive map
- `static_fig_title`: The title to appear on the static map
- `init_zoom`: The initial zoom level of the interactive map. The default is 7. You may need to adjust it depending on the size of the region.
- `open_street_file_name`: The file name (without suffix) to give to a map using OpenStreetMap data. The suffix is added automatically depending on whether it's dynamic (.html) or static (.png)
- `mapbox_file_name`: Just like the above but with regard to Mapbox
- `static_width`: The width of the static image. You may need to adjust from the default depending on the region.
- `static_height`: The height of the static image. You may need to adjust from the default depending on the region.
