I've been going through the lessons and projects at Free Code Camp. To implement the projects, I've been using a free account at CodePen, but for the project I'm currently working on, I wanted to be able to include images. The problem is that the free account at CodePen doesn't let a user store assets. That's where this blog comes in. I'm going to stores the images in my assets folder. Here they are:

![Technical Document](/assets/BPL.png)

![Product Landing](/assets/AUB.png)

![Survey Form](/assets/Survey.png)

![Tribute Page](/assets/tribute.png)

Now, I can use their URLs in my Free Code Camp project.
